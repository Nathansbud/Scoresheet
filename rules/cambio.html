        <p>Cambio is a memory game best played at 4 or more players, where players aim to end each round with the lowest score total.</p>
        <p>Each player has a facedown, 2-by-2 grid of cards in front of them, surrounding a central deck and discard pile. The round begins with each player looking at the 2 cards closest to them, then returning them to their prior positions</p>
        <p>Play proceeds in a circle: each player draws a card off the deck, and makes a choice to either swap with one of their facedown cards, or discard immediately.</p>
        <p>If a swap is made, the swapped card is discarded.</p>
        <p>If an immediate discard is made, a unique ability is triggered depending on the card.</p>
        <p>In either case:<b>any player who knows the position of a card of equal value to the discarded card may reveal it and discard it.</b> If the card is from their own grid, they now have one fewer card; if the card is from an opponent's grid, the discarding player may move one of their cards to that opponent grid.</p>
        <p>The immediate discard effects are as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>7 or 8: Look at a card in personal grid</li>
            <li>9 or 10: Look at a card in an opponent grid</li>
            <li>J or Q: Swap 2 cards in any grids</li>
            <li>K: Look at 2 cards in any grids, and swap 2 cards in any grids</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any player may, at the end of their turn, declare Cambio (typically when they believe they hold the lowest point total), after which point all other players have one final turn. After each player has taken their turn, the round is scored.</p>
        <p>Card score values are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Red Kings: -1 Points</li>
            <li>Joker: 0 Points</li>
            <li>A: 1 Point</li>
            <li>2â€“10: Face Value</li>
            <li>J, Q, Black Kings: 10 Points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The player with the lowest total of cards in their person grid is declared the winner of the round. <b>The game has no set endpoint, but a common house rule is to play until a player has won 4 rounds.</b></p>
